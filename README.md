# I'm Ava 👋  
Welcome to my little corner of GitHub — where systems, law and code all kinda mix together.  
I’m the girl who like low-level logic, data ethics, and making software that doesn’t just *run* — it behaves how I want… well, mostly.

Sit down and let’s talk a bit.

## Who am I?
- ⚙️ Honestly I’m very into systems programming — the closer to the metal, the better it feels for me.
- 📚 Studying business law & operational law to understand how real companies actually works and what they doing.
- 🔐 Big interest in privacy frameworks (GDPR, CCPA) and how it change engineering choices a lot.
- 🧠 Slowly becoming someone who kinda enjoy reading compliance docs (I know, it sounds weird haha).
- 🚀 Diving more into Rust, Go, C/C++ and some AI stuff too.
- 🎯 My goal? Build reliable systems that take data serious — performance *and* ethics both matter.
- 🇨🇦 I also speak French, because I live in Canada and grow up around both languages.

## What about AI?
Yeah, I’m learning it — but more from the engineering side.  
- 🔥 **PyTorch** is where I make most experiments  
- 🧠 Trying to understand how models works inside  
- ⚙️ Systems + AI = dealing with performance, memory and weird behavior sometimes

## Why the law stuff?
Easy: software shapes the world, and law shapes the software.  
I’m studying:
- **Business law**  
- **Operational law**  
- **Data protection stuff**  
- **Risk and compliance structures**

Because knowing this helps you build systems that don’t break when real-world rules hit them hard.

## Stats, if you want proof.

## What am I learning right now?
- ⚙️ **Rust** — Safety without too much fear.  
- 🚀 **Go** — Simple, fast, very fun to write actually.  
- 🧵 **C/C++** — Memory, performance, all the low-level chaos.  
- 🤖 **PyTorch + AI fundamentals** — Making models behaves… sometimes they don’t.  
- 📘 **Operational law** — How companies manage risk and responsibility.

## Why do I code?
Because systems is fascinating.  
Because rules — legal or technical — makes things more interesting.  
Because software should be something people trust, not only use it.
